# COLOUR-DETECTION
PLC (Ladder Logic) based sorting system project that uses color sensors to automate the system using TIA portal V15, Factory I/O. The system consists of a conveyor belt to carry products and color sensors to sense the color type of the products, the system now utilizes two pushers to push the product in their respective collection conveyor belt. The color sensor is used to identify object passing on the conveyor based on specific color. As soon as the required color is identified the sensor passes a specific signal to the PLC which in turn operates the respective pusher to push out products in respective conveyor belt. So this way we have developed the fully automated color based sorting system.
